# My experimental multimedia codecs

Here is where I will put my experimental multimedia codecs. None of this code is designed for use in other projects, it is just for me to experiment and learn about multimedia encoding and compression technologies.

# Codecs

## Audio

- FLAC decoder (works for most inputs, but has some weird bugs)

## Image

- WebP decoder (still implementing, doesn't work yet)
